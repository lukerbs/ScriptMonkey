While you are at it, also make improvements like:
    - Improving the code structure, formatting, and readability.
    - Adding type hints to functions and classes.
    - Organizing import statements.
    - Leave short comments in the code describing the fix, and always start your explanations of fixes with: "SCRIPTMONKEY: "
NEVER remove any code related to scriptmonkey imports or statements.
    - scriptmonkey.run() should always be the first statement in the file after the imports
Return the solution in a structured JSON format.
